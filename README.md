Hello! 
It`s my small project as a junior front-end developer.
In this project 
I wanted to create a convenient application so that the user can make a small correction of his photo (brightness, contrast, temperature, etc.). I also implemented the ability to apply the effect if the user does not want to do everything manually.
I also implemented the ability to add a vignette.
